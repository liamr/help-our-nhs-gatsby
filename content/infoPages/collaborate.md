Starting with some kind donations from local businesses, Help Our NHS has grown into a nationwide distribution network of supplies to frontline staff.  Such donations are very much still required and can include anything ranging from packaged foods, drinks, and snacks to hot meals to toiletries & “thank you” gifts for the staff.

If you may be able to help in some way, big or small, please get in touch via our **Contact** page and we can either assist with getting donations from A to B or point you in the best direction to help.
